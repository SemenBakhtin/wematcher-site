                <li>the right to access;
                  <p>You have the right to confirmation as to whether we process your personal data and, where we do, access to the personal data. Providing the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, we will supply to you a copy of your personal data. The first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable fee. You can ask for your personal data by contacting our Customer Support.</p>
                </li>
                <li>the right to rectification;

                <li>the right to object to processing;
                  <p>You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the processing is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</p>
                </li>
                <li>the right to restriction; 
                  <p>You can request that your data no longer be processed in certain cases, for instance, when you exercise your right to object as described above, or when you contest the accuracy of your personal data processed by us.</p>
                </li>
                <li>the right to data portability;
                  <p>To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal data is consent, and such processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your personal data from us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.</p>
                </li>
                <li>the right to complain to a supervisory authority; 
                  <p>If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.</p>
                </li>
                <li>the right to withdraw consent.
                  <p>To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.</p>
                  <p>Without prejudice to the aforementioned, if we have reasonable doubts concerning the identity of a user exercising their rights referred to in Section 10.1 or if we otherwise due to security reasons deem it necessary, we may request the provision of additional information and otherwise use all reasonable measures necessary to confirm the identity of the user.</p>
                  <p>You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by contacting our Customer Support. Concerning "Right to erasure" users are also able to request the deletion of their account through our Service.</p>
