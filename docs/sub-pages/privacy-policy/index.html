              of the rights are complex, might contain restrictions depending on the legal basis for processing the data
              and not all the details have been included in our summaries. Accordingly, you should read the relevant

          <div class="section__text-text">
            <p>10.1. Your principal rights under data protection law are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>the right to access;
                <p>You have the right to confirmation as to whether we process your personal data and, where we do,
                  access to the personal data. Providing the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, we will
                  supply to you a copy of your personal data. The first copy will be provided free of charge, but
                  additional copies may be subject to a reasonable fee. You can ask for your personal data by contacting
                  our Customer Support.</p>
              </li>
              <li>the right to rectification;
                <p>You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you rectified and, considering the
                  purposes of the processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you completed.</p>
              </li>
              <li>the right to erasure;
                <p>You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you rectified and, considering the
                  purposes of the processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you completed.</p>
              </li>
              <li>the right to object to processing;
                <p>You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your
                  particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the
                  processing is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the
                  exercise of any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued
                  by us or by a third party. If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal
                  information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override
                  your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defense
                  of legal claims.</p>
              </li>
              <li>the right to restriction;
                <p>You can request that your data no longer be processed in certain cases, for instance, when you
                  exercise your right to object as described above, or when you contest the accuracy of your personal
                  data processed by us.</p>
              </li>
              <li>the right to data portability;
                <p>To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal data is consent, and such
                  processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your personal data from us
                  in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where
                  it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.</p>
              </li>
              <li>the right to complain to a supervisory authority;
                <p>If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you
                  have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection.
                  You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of
                  the alleged infringement.</p>
              </li>
              <li>the right to withdraw consent.
                <p>To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you
                  have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of
                  processing before the withdrawal.</p>
                <p>Without prejudice to the aforementioned, if we have reasonable doubts concerning the identity of a
                  user exercising their rights referred to in Section 10.1 or if we otherwise due to security reasons
                  deem it necessary, we may request the provision of additional information and otherwise use all
                  reasonable measures necessary to confirm the identity of the user.</p>
                <p>You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by contacting our Customer
                  Support. Concerning "Right to erasure" users are also able to request the deletion of their account
                  through our Service.</p>
