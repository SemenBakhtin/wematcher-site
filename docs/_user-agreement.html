Payments are non-refundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods, except that we may approve a refund in the form of a credit on request if exceptional circumstances exist. If you believe exceptional circumstances exist, please contact us and explain the circumstances that you believe merits a refund. We are not making any promise that we will give you a refund. If we give you a refund, we will issue the refund in the form of free services or a credit to the payment method you used for your purchase; we will not make refunds in the form of cash or check. The provision of a refund in one instance does not entitle you to a refund in the future for similar instances; nor does it obligate us to provide refunds in the future, under any circumstance.</p>
